# Jigsaw Tech Test

## Introduction

You should aim to take no longer than 2 - 3 hours on this test. Don't worry about not being able to complete it, just send over what you have. We are just looking at how you approach a few different components based on the provided designs.

## Brief

We are nearing completion of a website for a company called "Jigsaw" who are an Insurance Specialist based in Harrogate. The design attached with this tech test was designed in house by Creode and is for a WordPress site we built recently. The aim of this tech test is to mockup as much of the design as you can within the allotted time.

Within the folder of this project we have provided the following:

 - An index.html file based on a HTML5 Boilerplate to get you up and running quickly
 - Any Images you may need from the designs
 - A replacement Font which is a close match to the one used on the designs: **(the designs use "Proxima Nova", which we can't provide on this test due to licensing).**
 - A normalise CSS file to get you started quickly

You are free to remove the normalise CSS file if you'd prefer not to use it.

You can use any frameworks, libraries or preprocessors you wish in order to complete this task.

## Deliverables

 - A zipped up folder containing the work you have done for this task
 - A brief write-up of any key decisions you made (and why!) and details of any bits you didn't manage to add within the 2 - 3 hours time but you'd like to.

All the deliverables should be emailed to guy.weston@creode.co.uk once you have finished.

Best of luck and have fun :)
